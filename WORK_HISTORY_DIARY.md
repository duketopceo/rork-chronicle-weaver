### CRITICAL BUG FIX - App Loading Issue Resolved (June 20, 2025 - 12:00 PM)

#### üêõ **Root Cause Identified & Fixed**
- **tRPC Configuration Error** - Environment variable mismatch causing app crash
  - Issue: tRPC client looking for `EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL` 
  - Reality: Environment variable named `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
  - Result: JavaScript error on startup preventing React app from rendering
- **Firebase Initialization** - Added defensive error handling to prevent crashes
  - Wrapped Firebase init in try-catch blocks
  - Added console logging for debugging
  - Made Analytics initialization optional if it fails

#### üîß **Technical Fixes Applied**
- **tRPC Client Configuration**:
  - Fixed environment variable name mismatch
  - Added fallback URL resolution (current domain or chronicleweaver.com)
  - Removed throwing error that was crashing the app
  - Added fetch error logging for network debugging
- **Firebase Initialization**:
  - Switched from `Constants.expoConfig` to direct `process.env` access
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Made Analytics initialization non-blocking
- **Layout Component Debugging**:
  - Added console logging throughout component lifecycle
  - Enhanced splash screen error handling
  - Added render debugging to track component mounting

#### üìä **Environment Variable Corrections**
- **Before**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL` (undefined, causing crash)
- **After**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (properly configured in .env.local)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Uses current domain or chronicleweaver.com if env missing
- **Error Handling**: No longer throws fatal errors on missing variables

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Defensive Programming Added**
- **Try-catch blocks** around all initialization code
- **Console logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Graceful degradation** if services fail to initialize
- **Fallback values** for all critical configuration

  - Logs detailed information about DOM state and app progress
  - Console logging for all initialization steps
  - Visual error indicator if loading fails
- **Security Alert Identified** - Detected malicious script injection in browser
  - External script tag with suspicious hash being injected
  - Not present in our source files (clean)
  - Likely browser extension or network-level injection
  - Our code is secure - issue is external

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Debug Features Implemented**
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Checks for React content in DOM every second
- **Console Logging**: Detailed debug output for troubleshooting

# Work History Diary - Chronicle Weaver Deployment

## Latest Session: June 20, 2025 - IMPORT.META ISSUE RESOLVED! ‚úÖ

### üéØ CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed ES Module Loading Issues

**Major Issue Resolved:**
- ‚ùå **FIXED**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: import.meta may only appear in a module` error
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: React app now loads properly after enhanced loading screen
- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**: No more infinite loading screen - app functionality restored

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The issue was caused by ES module syntax (`import.meta.env`) in the Zustand state management library
- The Expo build process was generating bundles with ES module syntax but serving them without proper module declaration
- Firebase was correctly serving the files, but the browser couldn't execute the bundle due to module type mismatch

**Technical Fixes Applied:**
- **Zustand Library Update**: Switched to a custom fork of Zustand that doesn't use `import.meta`
- **App State Management**: Refactored app state management to avoid `import.meta` usage
- **Environment Variable Access**: Replaced `import.meta.env` with direct `process.env` access
- **Firebase Hosting Configuration**: Ensured correct public directory and rewrites in `firebase.json`
- **Build & Deployment**: Re-ran Expo build and Firebase deployment steps

**Next Steps:**
1. **Monitor App Performance** - Ensure no regressions or new issues introduced
2. **Test All Features** - Verify core functionality and edge cases
3. **Custom Domain Setup** - Configure chronicleweaver.com with SSL
4. **Final Documentation Review** - Ensure all changes and setups are well-documented

**Current Status:**
- üåê **DEPLOYED**: https://chronicle-weaver-460713.web.app
- üîß **DEBUG**: Interactive debug panel available
- üìä **MONITORING**: Real-time app status tracking
- ‚ö° **PERFORMANCE**: Fast loading with visual progress

The site now provides better user feedback during loading and comprehensive debugging tools for troubleshooting any issues.
