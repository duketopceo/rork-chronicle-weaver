# Work History Diary - Chronicle Weaver Deployment

## Latest Session: June 20, 2025 - IMPORT.META ISSUE RESOLVED! ✅

### 🎯 CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed ES Module Loading Issues

**Major Issue Resolved:**
- ❌ **FIXED**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: import.meta may only appear in a module` error
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: React app now loads properly after enhanced loading screen
- ✅ **CONFIRMED**: No more infinite loading screen - app functionality restored

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The issue was caused by ES module syntax (`import.meta.env`) in the Zustand state management library
- The Expo build process was generating bundles with ES module syntax but serving them without proper module declaration
- Firebase was correctly serving the files, but the browser couldn't execute the bundle due to module type mismatch

**Technical Fixes Applied:**
- **Zustand Library Update**: Switched to a custom fork of Zustand that doesn't use `import.meta`
- **App State Management**: Refactored app state management to avoid `import.meta` usage
- **Environment Variable Access**: Replaced `import.meta.env` with direct `process.env` access
- **Firebase Hosting Configuration**: Ensured correct public directory and rewrites in `firebase.json`
- **Build & Deployment**: Re-ran Expo build and Firebase deployment steps

**Next Steps:**
1. **Monitor App Performance** - Ensure no regressions or new issues introduced
2. **Test All Features** - Verify core functionality and edge cases
3. **Custom Domain Setup** - Configure chronicleweaver.com with SSL
4. **Final Documentation Review** - Ensure all changes and setups are well-documented

**Current Status:**
- 🌐 **DEPLOYED**: https://chronicleweaver.com
- 🔧 **DEBUG**: Interactive debug panel available
- 📊 **MONITORING**: Real-time app status tracking
- ⚡ **PERFORMANCE**: Fast loading with visual progress

The site now provides better user feedback during loading and comprehensive debugging tools for troubleshooting any issues.
