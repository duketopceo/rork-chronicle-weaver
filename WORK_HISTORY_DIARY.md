- ‚úÖ **Firebase Project** - Confirmed `chronicle-weaver-460713` project configuration
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables** - Verified `.env.local` with all required Firebase config
- ‚úÖ **Git Repository** - All changes staged for commit

### Configuration Files Updated
- ‚úÖ **tsconfig.json** - Updated module resolution and target for modern ES support
- ‚úÖ **firebase.json** - Hosting configuration verified
- ‚úÖ **.firebaserc** - Project configuration confirmed
- ‚úÖ **package.json** - All build scripts verified

### Code Fixes Applied
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Errors** - Fixed type issues in multiple files:
  - `components/DebugPanel.tsx` - Fixed GameState and PerformanceMetrics types
  - `types/game.ts` - Added missing DebugInfo and PerformanceMetrics interfaces
  - `app/_layout.tsx` - Fixed dynamic import and module resolution
- ‚úÖ **Build Configuration** - Updated webpack and TypeScript configs for compatibility

### Build & Deployment Process
- ‚úÖ **Expo Web Build** - Successfully built with `bun run build:web`
  - Generated `dist/` directory with all web assets
  - Created production-ready bundle
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Deployment** - Deployed to Firebase Hosting
  - Live URL: https://chronicle-weaver-460713.web.app
  - Deployment successful but site shows blank page
- ‚ùå **Production Build** - Encountered TypeScript/webpack errors
  - Worked around by using Expo web build instead

### Issues Identified
- üîç **Blank Page Issue** - Deployed site loads but shows blank page
  - Root cause: Incorrect `index.html` being served
  - Firebase serving default template instead of React app entry point
  - Located in `public/index.html` vs generated `dist/index.html`

### Documentation Created
- ‚úÖ **FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive deployment guide
- ‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step deployment checklist
- ‚úÖ **deploy-to-firebase.ps1** - PowerShell deployment script
- ‚úÖ **quick-deploy.ps1** - Simplified deployment script

### Git Status
- ‚úÖ **All changes staged** - Ready for commit and push
- ‚úÖ **Work history documented** - This diary file created

### Next Session Priorities (Tomorrow)
1. **Fix Blank Page Issue**
   - Investigate `dist/index.html` vs `public/index.html` discrepancy
   - Ensure correct React app entry point is deployed
   - Update Firebase hosting configuration if needed

2. **Complete Deployment**
   - Verify app loads correctly after fix
   - Test all features on deployed site
   - Custom domain setup (chronicleweaver.com)

3. **Final Documentation**
   - Update deployment docs with blank page fix
   - Create user guide for the deployed app
   - Document custom domain setup process

### Technical Notes
- **Build Output**: Expo generates `dist/` with correct React app structure
- **Firebase Config**: Currently points to `public/` directory instead of `dist/`
- **Deployment Strategy**: May need to update `firebase.json` to use `dist/` as public directory
- **Custom Domain**: DNS configuration and SSL setup pending

### Time Investment
- **Setup & Dependencies**: ~1 hour
- **Code Fixes & TypeScript**: ~2 hours  
- **Build & Deployment**: ~1.5 hours
- **Documentation**: ~1 hour
- **Troubleshooting**: ~1.5 hours
- **Total**: ~7 hours
