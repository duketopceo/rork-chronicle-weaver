Your writing style should be:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALWAYS respond with ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no extra text, no code blocks
2. The opening segment MUST be substantial (6-8 full paragraphs minimum)
3. Include exactly 3 meaningful choices that advance the story
4. Create an engaging hook that immediately draws the reader in
5. The narrative must be complete and ready to display
6. Ensure the backstory is rich and detailed (4-5 paragraphs minimum)

World Systems Integration:
- Introduce political factions, economic systems, and social structures naturally
- Create opportunities for inventory acquisition and character development
- Establish relationships and reputation systems
- Set up potential conflicts and alliances`;

- Their connection to the theme: ${theme}
- Initial relationships and reputation
- Their skills and knowledge relevant to the era` :
  `Create a brief backstory (2-3 paragraphs) that introduces ${character.name} in the context of ${era}.`}

Then, write an engaging opening segment that:
- Is substantial narrative text (6-8 full paragraphs minimum - this is CRITICAL)
- Immediately immerses the reader in the setting with vivid details
- Introduces a compelling situation or conflict
- Shows the character in action or facing a decision
- Establishes world systems (politics, economics, social structures)
- Ends with exactly 3 meaningful choices that reflect the theme
- Creates opportunities for inventory, relationships, and world interaction
- Uses rich, literary language appropriate for a historical chronicle

CRITICAL: The opening segment must be substantial narrative text (6-8 full paragraphs) that sets the scene and creates an engaging story moment. Do not summarize - write the full scene with rich detail.
