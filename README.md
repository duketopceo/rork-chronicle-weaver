## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Bun package manager
- Expo CLI
- Firebase project (for authentication and data)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd rork-chronicle-weaver

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run start

# For web development
bun run start-web
```

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your values
2. Set up Firebase project and add credentials to `.env`
3. Configure AI service integration (optional)
4. Update any custom domain settings

## üîß Development

### Key Development Commands
- `bun run start`: Start mobile development server
- `bun run start-web`: Start web development server  
- `bun run start-web-dev`: Start with debug logging

### Code Organization
- Use TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Follow Expo Router file-based routing conventions
- Maintain type definitions in `/types` directory
- Keep components pure and reusable
- Use Zustand for state management
- Validate all data with Zod schemas

## üì± Platform Support

- **iOS**: Native iOS app via Expo
- **Android**: Native Android app via Expo
- **Web**: Progressive web app via Expo web

## üîê Security & Privacy

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- All API keys and sensitive data should be in environment variables
- Firebase configuration uses environment variables for security
- See `docs/security.md` for detailed security considerations

**Environment Variables Required:**
- Firebase configuration (API keys, project ID, etc.)
- AI service credentials (if using external AI)
- Custom domain settings

## ÔøΩ Deployment

### Automated Deployment
