# Chronicle Weaver - Repository Restructure Complete

## What We've Done

### 1. Branch Structure Created
- **`deprecated`** - Contains the complete original Chronicle Weaver codebase
- **`rewrite`** - Clean slate for the new version with essential configs only
- **`v1`** - Previous backup branch (can be removed if needed)

### 2. Firebase Deployment Configuration
- **Current Setup**: Firebase deploys from the `rewrite` branch
- **Original Code**: Preserved in `deprecated` branch, not deployed
- **Workflow**: Updated `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml` to deploy from `rewrite` branch

### 3. Essential Configs Preserved
The `rewrite` branch contains only:
- ✅ `.env.example` - Environment variables template (Firebase, API keys, etc.)
- ✅ `firebase.json` - Firebase hosting configuration
- ✅ `.firebaserc` - Firebase project configuration
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- ✅ `README.md` - Project documentation
- ✅ `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions for deployment
- ✅ `docs/` - Complete documentation
- ✅ `package.json` - Clean package.json for v2.0.0

### 4. Next Steps for Rewrite
You now have a clean slate to rebuild Chronicle Weaver. You'll need to:

1. **Set up basic React Native + Expo structure**
2. **Add dependencies** (React Native, Expo Router, TypeScript, etc.)
3. **Configure Firebase integration** (using the preserved configs)
4. **Implement Stripe/billing** (reference the subscription types from deprecated branch if needed)
5. **Build new AI narrative system**

### 5. Key Preserved Information
From the original codebase, you may want to reference:
- **Subscription types**: See `deprecated` branch `src/types/game.ts` for subscription interfaces
- **Firebase configs**: Already preserved in current branch
- **Deployment setup**: Already configured to work with new structure

### 6. How to Access Original Code
```bash
# Switch to deprecated branch to see original code
git checkout deprecated

# Switch back to rewrite for new development
git checkout rewrite
```

## Ready for Development!
Your Firebase app will now deploy from the `rewrite` branch, and you have a clean foundation to build Chronicle Weaver v2.0 with all the essential configurations preserved.
